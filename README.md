# Naming

```
There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
-- Phil Karlton
```

People tend to existing names from other contexts to name their software services, products, releases and components.
E.g. Mouse, bug - not really computer terms, but they have extra meaning in computer context.

This repo lists of names from other domains for naming stuff. 
Easy to use for name automation.
